follow the usual arch installation video whihc you see all the time,


then install xfce4 xfce4-goodies

config the panel to your liking.




2. install i3-gaps i3-status


After this go to "Session and Startup" >> "Current Session" and then change xfdesktop and xfwm to "Never" in Restart Style.

Then go to "application autostart" tab, add a new application:

Name: i3
Description: Tiling Window Manager
Command: i3



3. install rofi, feh, picom


4. make the keysyms for 
mod+q to kill,
mod+d to run rofi, 
feh bg on startups
mod+shift+x for shutdown

add "--no-startup-id" flag to pretty much every exec commands, to prevent the loading cursor bug (my hunch is on the exec feh command, as the loading cursor shows up only when im pointing the mouse to the wallpaper).

remove the bar{}  in config file, add the "gap" stuff in your config file.



5. Also set the PS1 value, check the centos config for that.
