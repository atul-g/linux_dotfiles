# Linux Dotfiles
A personal repo where I keep all my linux configuration files. This is meant to serve as a backup and easy access over all my installed distros for a quick configuration.

### Contents:
1. `xfce4-i3-config` - Contains the config file for `i3-gaps` WM I use in my Arch Linux with Xfce4.  
2. `PS1_value`: A bash prompt config value to my liking.
3. `.vimrc` : My config for `.vimrc`. I prefer using  4 tab indentation and shift values.
