1. Dont install orca. It is for visually impaired.
2. Install xorg-xbacklight to make brightness buttons work.
3. Try installing optimus-manager-qt
4. Install kdeconnect.
5. Disable element notifications for endeavour os in kdeconnect android app.

6. For batCheck.sh, there is no crond in arch linux, so you may have to create a systemd
timer.

make a file in:
~/.config/systemd/user/batCheck.service
contents of the file:
```
[Unit]V

Description=Battery Monitor Service

[Service]
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/home/atulu/.Xauthority
ExecStart=/home/atulu/batCheck.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

make sure chmod + batCheck.sh

and then execute: systemctl --user enable batCheck.service; systemctl --user start batCheck;


7. Blacklist alx module: in /etc/modeprobe.d/blacklist file:
```
blacklist alx 
```

8. For fonts, put the list of .ttf files in ~/.fonts and execute:
$ fc-cache -fv
$ fc-list | grep part-of-font-name

Use this font name in i3's config file. For some reason, in bar {} in config file, 
changing font means, you have to delete the currently given fonts names and put your
font name alone for it to work.
